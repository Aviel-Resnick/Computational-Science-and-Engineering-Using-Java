One of the interactive simulations that I tried was "Rutherford Scattering", which mimicked Ernest Rutherford's famous experiment, during which he redefined our understanding of the atom. The main portion of the experiment was firing alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold, and observing as a small percentage of the particles bounced back (due to the nucleus), while the rest passed through. The simulation allows the user to view an atom from a top down perspective, which makes the alpha particles and the nucleus visible. According to Phet, "[The purpose is to] simulate the famous experiment in which he disproved the Plum Pudding model of the atom by observing alpha particles bouncing off atoms and determining that they must have a small core." Based on what I tried, the simulation achieved that goal very well, and demonstrated an important scientific concept. In addition, I found it interesting that on a secondary tab, the plum pudding model which was disproved by this experiment can be seen. Overall, I though that the "Rutherford Scattering" model was very interesting, and very well done as well.
